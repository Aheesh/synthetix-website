						Each Vault supports a single collateral asset. Pools connected to

						the protocol through Synthetix governance. Stakers have an
						increasing range of Pools to allocate their capital to. This gives
						stakers more control over their credit as the V3 system provides
						more options for both liquidity and hedging.
